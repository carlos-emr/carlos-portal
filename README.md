# CARLOS Patient Portal

This repository contains the Python/FastAPI implementation of the CARLOS patient credential
portal.

The MVP foundation currently includes:

- FastAPI application factory.
- Pydantic settings with `PATIENT_PORTAL_` environment variables.
- SQLAlchemy session configuration.
- Alembic migration scaffold with the initial invite and account tables.
- Minimal public `/health` liveness endpoint.
- Internal `/internal/health/db` database readiness endpoint.
- Server-rendered responsive sign-in, activation, password-reset, lockout, and MFA screens.
- Authenticated CARLOS internal API for invites, unlock, contact review, and unlock-secret
  create/revoke operations, plus a development-only staff API for local testing.
- Seven-day invite expiry metadata; resend supersedes the old issuance and creates a linked record.
- Patient invite activation using invite code, email, date of birth, and HCN/HIN proof.
- Activation attempt throttling backed by portal audit events and PostgreSQL transaction locks.
- Patient login with Argon2id password verification, MFA challenge/verify, opaque bearer sessions,
  logout, password reset, lockout, staff unlock, and forced reset after unlock.
- Authenticated dashboard landing page with Account, Email passwords, and Help modules plus disabled
  placeholders for future Documents and Messages modules.
- Encrypted unlock-secret storage service for generated passphrases used by CARLOS encrypted email
  attachments.
- Pilot hardening hooks for readiness checks, maintenance mode, coarse request throttling, audit
  retention pruning, and local SQLite backup/restore drills.
- Patient-scoped FHIR R4 metadata/read/search endpoints with bounded paging and access auditing,
  plus an HL7 v2.5.1 patient-registration conformance artifact.
- Tests for app wiring, template rendering, database readiness, invite lifecycle,
  activation/auth/unlock-secret behavior, scoped patient APIs, FHIR/HL7 artifacts, PostgreSQL
  behavior, desktop/mobile Playwright workflows, and pilot hardening hooks.

## Current MVP Status

| Slice | Portal status | Remaining integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation and activation | Portal implementation and tests present | CARLOS invite delivery and activation-link UI are not wired |
| Authentication and MFA | Portal implementation, durable reset outbox, and account-scoped controls present | Deploy and tune the shared edge throttling policy |
| Dashboard and email passwords | Portal implementation and responsive tests present | CARLOS must confirm successful message delivery before publishing each password |
| Account settings | Changed email and phone destinations require independent ownership proof; immutable sync reviews are queued | CARLOS must update eChart then idempotently confirm the reviewed revision |
| FHIR R4 and HL7 v2.5.1 | Scoped resources and conformance artifacts are validator-tested | This is a narrow portal profile, not a general-purpose exchange server |
| Pilot hardening | Reference edge/role policies and operator commands are present | External monitoring, protected audit sink, managed backups, and restore drills remain required |

Why this is a separate Python service with its own PostgreSQL database, what was traded away, and
the conditions under which the decision should be revisited are recorded in
[`docs/architecture/patient-portal-runtime.md`](docs/architecture/patient-portal-runtime.md).

The current MVP deliberately uses one isolated portal deployment, database, origin, and configured
clinic identity per clinic. It is not a shared multi-clinic identity service. The portal-side API
contract is deployable only after the CARLOS Java application is wired to it.
Green portal CI does not by itself prove that staff can reach these actions from CARLOS.

## Five-minute standalone demo

This starts only the patient portal with disposable SQLite data. It does not require CARLOS,
PostgreSQL, SMTP, or an SMS provider. SQLite and the on-page MFA code are development conveniences;
do not use this configuration for patient data or a pilot deployment.

From the repository root, run the following block in one shell with Python 3.11 or 3.12:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .

export PORTAL_DEMO_DIRECTORY="$(mktemp -d)"
export PATIENT_PORTAL_ENVIRONMENT=development
export PATIENT_PORTAL_DATABASE_URL="sqlite+pysqlite:///${PORTAL_DEMO_DIRECTORY}/portal.db"
export PATIENT_PORTAL_IDENTITY_PROOF_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
export PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_HASH_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
export PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"

python -m alembic upgrade head
python tests/seed_browser.py
python -m uvicorn carlos_patient_portal.main:create_app \
  --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8090
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8090/> and sign in with:

- Username: `CarlosPatient`
- Password: `Nectar` + `-Sparrow` + `-Quartz` + `-87!` (concatenate without spaces)
- MFA: use the development code displayed on the verification page

The seeded account has twelve sample email-password records. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`. The
database is stored under the temporary directory printed by `echo "$PORTAL_DEMO_DIRECTORY"`; remove
that directory when the demo data is no longer needed. Keep the same shell environment if you
restart this demo, because the generated secrets are required to read its existing data. To start
over cleanly, open a new shell and repeat the block, which creates a new temporary directory.

## Local Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/carlos-patient-portal-venv
. /tmp/carlos-patient-portal-venv/bin/activate
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .
```

The local lock file includes runtime, development, and build dependencies with package hashes.
Production deployments should install a prebuilt portal wheel with the runtime-only lock file:

```bash
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-runtime.lock
pip install --no-deps dist/carlos_patient_portal-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
carlos-patient-portal-migrate
```

The repository also ships a digest-pinned production container, separate web/migration/outbox
services, least-privilege database-policy job, and deploy/rollback automation. See
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for the production deployment path.
Real patient information additionally requires the per-clinic evidence gates in
[`deploy/REAL_DATA_READINESS.md`](deploy/REAL_DATA_READINESS.md).

Refresh the lock files after dependency changes with:

```bash
pip-compile --generate-hashes --strip-extras \
  --output-file requirements-runtime.lock pyproject.toml
pip-compile --extra dev --all-build-deps --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe --strip-extras \
  --output-file requirements.lock pyproject.toml
```

CI installs both lock files with hash verification and audits their exact versions against the
Python Packaging Advisory Database. Keep both generated locks in the same dependency-change commit.

### Dependency decisions

- `fhir.resources` remains pinned to 5.1.1 because it models FHIR R4 4.0.1. Newer major versions
  provide R5 and R4B rather than exact R4. Portal FHIR routes are output-only, and CI validates
  generated resources with the official FHIR validator rather than treating this library as the
  conformance authority. Reassess the model library before accepting inbound FHIR resources.
- The runtime installs base `uvicorn` only. Development installs `uvicorn[standard]` for reload and
  optional local performance support without shipping WebSocket and file-watcher dependencies in
  production.
- The MVP uses `psycopg[binary]` because there is not yet a managed production portal image. Its
  bundled client libraries are patched by updating the locked Psycopg package and rebuilding the
  deployment. When a production image is defined, evaluate `psycopg[c]` linked to image-managed
  `libpq` and `libssl`.
- `cryptography` tracks the current major line rather than a pinned one. 48.x carries
  PYSEC-2026-3552, 3553, and 3554; only 50.0.0 fixes all three, so the floor is 50.0.0. The portal
  uses it for AES-256-GCM and HKDF in `unlock_secrets`, so treat advisories against it as
  release-blocking rather than routine.
- The CI PostgreSQL service uses a digest-pinned `postgres:16.15-bookworm` image. Update the tag and
  digest together after reviewing upstream PostgreSQL image changes.

## Run

```bash
export PATIENT_PORTAL_ENVIRONMENT=development
uvicorn carlos_patient_portal.main:create_app --factory --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8090
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8090/`.

Production launchers must disable Uvicorn's raw request-target access log; the application emits
its own route-template log:

```bash
uvicorn carlos_patient_portal.main:create_app --factory --no-access-log \
  --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips=127.0.0.1
```

## Configuration

Settings use the `PATIENT_PORTAL_` environment prefix.

Common development variables:

```bash
export PATIENT_PORTAL_ENVIRONMENT=development
export PATIENT_PORTAL_ENABLE_DEV_ADMIN=true
export PATIENT_PORTAL_CLINIC_NAME="Maple Creek Medical"
export PATIENT_PORTAL_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8090"
export PATIENT_PORTAL_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://localhost:5432/carlos_portal"
# The development Postfix capture service listens locally without TLS or authentication.
export PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
export PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_PORT=25
# Set PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN to a 32+ character random value before using
# the development invite API.
# Set PATIENT_PORTAL_IDENTITY_PROOF_SECRET to a 32+ character random value when
# seeded invites must survive app restarts.
# Set PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_HASH_SECRET to a separate 32+ character random value
# when activation throttling/audit hashes must survive app restarts.
# Set PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_SECRET to a separate 32+ character
# random value when encrypted unlock secrets must survive app restarts.
```

The default database URL targets local PostgreSQL because PostgreSQL is the intended MVP database.
Most unit tests use SQLite; CI also runs security-critical concurrency and transaction behavior
against PostgreSQL 16. File-backed SQLite is supported for local development, not a shared pilot.
Production startup rejects SQLite and every database driver except `postgresql+psycopg`.
Database pool, connect, checkout, statement, and lock timeouts have explicit configuration fields.
Remote production PostgreSQL URLs must use `sslmode=verify-full`; deliver database credentials and
CA material through the deployment secret manager rather than committed URLs.

The portal defaults to `production`, so deployments fail closed unless required secrets are set.
Local development should explicitly set `PATIENT_PORTAL_ENVIRONMENT=development`.

Development SMTP defaults to `carlos-test@openo-dev.local`; override it with
`PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` when needed. A sender address is always required outside
development. SMTP is required in production, and every non-development SMTP connection must enable
`PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_STARTTLS`. Relays can set
`PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_USERNAME` and `PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_PASSWORD`; the username and password must be
configured together. `PATIENT_PORTAL_SMTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to 10 seconds. MFA email bodies
contain only the verification code, expiry, service name, and clinic contact direction. They do not
include patient names or clinical information.
Outbound email and SMS wording is isolated in `outbound_messages.py`; English is the only enabled
outbound locale until account locale persistence and reviewed translations are added.

### Browser locales

The browser UI resolves a locale per request: an explicit choice in the `portal_locale` cookie
first, then the best supported match from `Accept-Language`, then English. `GET /locale/{code}`
records the choice and redirects back to a validated local path; it takes no CSRF token because the
cookie selects strings and a date format only, and carries no identity or authorization.

`SUPPORTED_LOCALES` advertises EN, FR, ES, PL, and PT-BR, and every one of them is selectable and
persists. **No translations are written yet**: `TEXT_CATALOG` holds an entry per locale, and
`portal_text()` merges the selected locale over English key by key, so an untranslated locale
renders English rather than failing. Adding a language therefore means adding keys to
`TEXT_CATALOG["<code>"]` and a date format to `DATETIME_FORMATS` — no route, template, or context
change — and a partially translated catalog renders correctly for the keys it does define.

`PATIENT_PORTAL_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is used to build password-reset email links and is required when
SMTP is configured outside development. It must use HTTPS outside development.

**Subpath hosting.** The value may carry a path — `https://portal.example.test/patient` — and the
prefix is applied consistently: emailed reset and email-change links, FHIR canonical and pagination
URLs, static assets, and form actions all include it, because the path is passed to FastAPI as
`root_path`. The proxy contract is the standard ASGI one: **strip the prefix before forwarding**.
The portal routes on `/auth/login` and generates `/patient/auth/login` back out. A proxy that
forwards the prefix unstripped will 404, because the app is not mounted under it.
The packaged Nginx reference includes a `/patient/` example location with a trailing-slash
`proxy_pass`; rename that location when choosing a different prefix. It also forwards
`X-Forwarded-Proto`, so the Uvicorn process must trust proxy headers only from the local Nginx
address as shown in the production launch command.

Setting it also makes that hostname the only `Host` header accepted for patient and FHIR traffic.
Health and readiness probes normally arrive under a different name (loopback, a pod IP, or a
Kubernetes service name), so `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` are accepted as probe aliases by
default.

**IPv6 address literals cannot be allowlisted.** Starlette's `TrustedHostMiddleware` derives the
host as `headers["host"].split(":")[0]`, which produces `[` for `Host: [::1]:8000` and an empty
string for `::1` — so no entry matches an IPv6 literal in either form, and the only pattern that
would match (`[`) would accept every IPv6 host. A probe that targets `http://[::1]:8080/health`
therefore receives `400 Invalid host header`, and on a dual-stack or IPv6-only cluster that reads as
an unhealthy pod. Point IPv6 probes at a hostname (a Kubernetes service name, or the canonical
public host) rather than an address literal, or keep the probe on IPv4 loopback. Add to that list with `PATIENT_PORTAL_PROBE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated) when probes
reach the service under another name — for example
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PROBE_ALLOWED_HOSTS="portal.svc.cluster.local,10.0.0.7"`. Configured aliases extend
the loopback defaults rather than replacing them; set
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PROBE_ALLOWED_HOSTS_EXCLUSIVE=true` if the deployment must not answer to loopback at
all. Entries must be literal hostnames — a wildcard is refused at startup, because Starlette's
`TrustedHostMiddleware` treats any `*` entry as "accept every host" and would disable canonical-Host
enforcement for the whole service. These aliases
only widen which `Host` headers are accepted; every generated patient-visible link continues to use
the canonical `PATIENT_PORTAL_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` origin. Reset tokens are put
in the link fragment so they are not sent in the initial HTTP request or written to access logs.
Matched password-reset requests are limited to one email per account per minute by default; tune
this with `PATIENT_PORTAL_PASSWORD_RESET_REQUEST_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`.
Production delivery runs after the uniform HTTP response so SMTP latency does not disclose whether
the submitted identity matched an account. Every non-development reset submission first writes the
same encrypted, account-neutral outbox command; only the worker resolves that identity and, on a
match, mints the token and queues its email. The public request therefore never performs the extra
token/outbox writes that would otherwise create a timing oracle. Reset links and post-change
security notices remain encrypted at rest. Start at least one worker alongside the web service;
leases recover work after process loss, retries retain a stable SMTP `Message-ID`, and terminal
reset-delivery failure revokes the undelivered token.

The active reset-request queue is capped by
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PASSWORD_RESET_QUEUE_MAX_PENDING` (1,000 by default). Admission is serialized with
a PostgreSQL transaction advisory lock across web workers. A full queue returns the same global
`503` for every submitted identity and a `Retry-After` controlled by
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PASSWORD_RESET_QUEUE_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS`; alert on the
`password_reset_queue_full` operational failure counter.

Start the worker with:

```bash
export PATIENT_PORTAL_OUTBOX_ENCRYPTION_SECRET="a separate 32+ character secret"
carlos-patient-portal-outbox-worker
```

The single secret is the compatibility format for a new deployment. To rotate it without making
already-queued messages unreadable, configure a JSON keyring instead and select the key used for
new deliveries:

```bash
export PATIENT_PORTAL_OUTBOX_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING='{"2026-07":"replace-with-old-32+-character-secret","2026-08":"replace-with-new-32+-character-secret"}'
export PATIENT_PORTAL_OUTBOX_ACTIVE_KEY_ID="2026-08"
carlos-patient-portal-outbox-worker
```

Restart the web and worker processes with the same keyring. Retain the old member until no pending
or processing outbox row carries its key ID; removing it sooner makes those deliveries fail with
`encryption_key_unavailable`. Once the old rows have drained, remove the old member and restart
both processes again.

Production SMS uses an authenticated HTTPS JSON webhook configured with
`PATIENT_PORTAL_SMS_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PATIENT_PORTAL_SMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`. The provider adapter receives
only the normalized destination, code, expiry, sender ID, and message purpose. Production startup
fails closed when SMS delivery is not configured.

The development container's capture-only Postfix setup stores messages locally instead of relaying
them externally. Use `/scripts/mail list` and `/scripts/mail read latest` to inspect captured MFA
and password-reset messages during testing.

Run the repeatable live browser smoke test from the repository root after seeding the development
account and starting the portal:

```bash
npm run test:patient-portal-playwright
```

The test clears the local capture inbox, signs in as the configurable development patient, retrieves
the MFA code through `/scripts/mail`, verifies the dashboard on desktop and mobile viewports, and
logs out. Override `PORTAL_BASE_URL`, `PORTAL_TEST_USER`, `PORTAL_TEST_PASSWORD`,
`PORTAL_MAIL_COMMAND`, or `PORTAL_SCREENSHOT_DIR` when the local setup differs from the defaults.
The test refuses public hosts unless `ALLOW_NON_LOCAL_BASE_URL=true` is deliberately set.

`PATIENT_PORTAL_CLINIC_ID` and `PATIENT_PORTAL_CLINIC_NAME` have development placeholders.
Non-development startup rejects those placeholders. The configured clinic is enforced on login
and on every CARLOS internal request; a request asserting another clinic is rejected.
`PATIENT_PORTAL_CLINIC_TIMEZONE` defaults to `America/Toronto`. Set the clinic's IANA timezone so
dashboard timestamps and date filters use the clinic's local calendar day; FHIR instants and
database storage remain UTC.
If the same value is used in HL7 v2 messages, keep it to letters, numbers, dots, underscores, or
hyphens, and 20 characters or fewer.

Non-development deployments must set `PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_HEALTH_TOKEN`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET`, `PATIENT_PORTAL_IDENTITY_PROOF_SECRET`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_HASH_SECRET`, `PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_STAFF_ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEY`, SMTP, SMS, either
`PATIENT_PORTAL_OUTBOX_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` or `PATIENT_PORTAL_OUTBOX_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING`, and either
`PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` or
`PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING`.
The internal readiness endpoint expects the health token as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_HEALTH_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/internal/health/db

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_HEALTH_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/internal/readiness

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_HEALTH_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/internal/metrics
```

Before a deployment may receive real patient information, run the installed preflight after
migrations and `postgresql-audit-roles.sql`:

```bash
carlos-patient-portal-preflight
```

It exits unsuccessfully unless production policy is active, the live database is PostgreSQL over
TLS, the packaged schema head is applied, the runtime role has no inherited privileges, database or
schema ownership, database administration, or schema creation, the migration revision is read-only,
the PostgreSQL search path is pinned to `pg_catalog,public`, temporary-object creation is disabled,
and relation, column, sequence, function, grant-option, and `PUBLIC` ACLs across user schemas match
the explicit application allowlist. Explicit user-schema ACLs and implicit object ownership for
undeclared database roles also fail the gate. Output is secret-free JSON so the result can be
attached to the deployment change record.

The production deployment wrapper additionally refuses to mutate PostgreSQL unless the migration,
runtime, audit-maintenance, and database-policy credentials resolve to the same physical cluster and
database under their declared roles. It also verifies that the host policy SQL exactly matches the
copy packaged in the immutable application image.

Expose `/internal/health/db` and `/internal/readiness` only to trusted infrastructure such as a load
balancer or orchestrator health probe.

Non-development secrets must be set explicitly, be at least 32 characters, and use distinct values
for each authentication, identity-proof, audit, health, internal API, SMS, and encryption domain.
`PATIENT_PORTAL_ENVIRONMENT` accepts `development`, `staging`, `test`, or `production`; `dev` and
`prod` are normalized aliases.

The development invite API requires `PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN` when
`PATIENT_PORTAL_ENABLE_DEV_ADMIN=true`. Keep that token local to development machines and pass it as a
Bearer token.

Activation throttling defaults to 10 failed attempts per invite code and 50 failed attempts per client
within a one-hour window. The deployment can tune this with
`PATIENT_PORTAL_ACTIVATION_FAILURE_WINDOW_SECONDS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_ACTIVATION_MAX_FAILURES_PER_INVITE`, and
`PATIENT_PORTAL_ACTIVATION_MAX_FAILURES_PER_CLIENT`.

Authentication defaults:

- MFA is required by default and cannot be disabled in production.
- Password login and account-setting step-up lock the account after 10 failed password attempts.
- MFA verification locks the account after 10 failed code attempts.
- MFA failures and delivery cooldowns are account-scoped across replacement challenges.
- A delivery the provider reports as failed shortens that account cooldown to a five-second retry
  grace rather than clearing it. A reported failure is not proof nothing was sent — greylisting, an
  SMTP timeout after `DATA`, and a gateway that returns 5xx after queueing all report failure having
  delivered — so clearing it would let a degraded provider flood a patient's mailbox or SMS number
  at the cost of one request each. The grace keeps the patient's retry to seconds instead of a full
  window while keeping the per-account send rate bounded.
- MFA codes expire after 10 minutes.
- Email MFA resend is limited to once per minute.
- SMS MFA is available when the account has a valid phone number and the webhook sender is
  configured; delivery failures are audited and do not silently invalidate another method.
- Patient sessions have a one-hour absolute lifetime and expire after 10 minutes of inactivity.
- Password reset tokens expire after one hour and are one-time use.
- Email-change confirmation links expire after 24 hours and are one-time use.
- Changed phone numbers receive a separate six-digit proof code; the account retains its current
  contact and recovery destinations until every changed destination has been confirmed.

The deployment can tune these with `PATIENT_PORTAL_REQUIRE_MFA`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_AUTH_MAX_FAILED_PASSWORD_ATTEMPTS`, `PATIENT_PORTAL_MFA_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`, `PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_MFA_CODE_TTL_SECONDS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_MFA_EMAIL_RESEND_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_MFA_SMS_RESEND_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`, and
`PATIENT_PORTAL_EMAIL_CHANGE_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`. Phone enrollment uses
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PHONE_CHANGE_CODE_TTL_SECONDS`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PHONE_CHANGE_RESEND_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, and
`PATIENT_PORTAL_PHONE_CHANGE_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS`.

By default, client throttling uses the direct peer address reported by the ASGI server. If the portal
runs behind a trusted proxy, set `PATIENT_PORTAL_TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` to `x-forwarded-for` or
`x-real-ip` and set `PATIENT_PORTAL_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` to the comma-separated CIDRs of proxies that
may supply that header. Forwarded values are ignored unless the direct peer is in that allowlist.
For `X-Forwarded-For`, the portal walks the chain from the right and uses the first untrusted hop.

Whichever header you choose, the proxy must **set** it rather than pass through whatever the client
sent. The peer check cannot protect you here: the peer is your own proxy, which is in
`PATIENT_PORTAL_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` by definition, so a forwarded header the proxy did not write is
accepted as genuine. If it is client-controlled, every client-keyed control — the request and login
throttles, the per-client activation budget, and the source address recorded in the audit trail —
becomes attacker-chosen.

The packaged `deploy/nginx.conf` satisfies this for both options: it overwrites `X-Real-IP` with
`$remote_addr`, and sets `X-Forwarded-For` to `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` so the real peer is
appended on the right, which is what the right-to-left walk expects. If you replace that config,
carry both directives over — and note that defining any `proxy_set_header` inside an nginx
`location` disables inheritance of the entire server-level set, so each such block needs its own
copy.

Pilot hardening defaults:

- Coarse per-process request throttling allows 300 patient-facing requests per client per minute,
  while login is limited to 10 attempts per client per minute before Argon2 work is scheduled.
  Tune with `PATIENT_PORTAL_GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`,
  `PATIENT_PORTAL_GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`,
  `PATIENT_PORTAL_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`, and
  `PATIENT_PORTAL_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`. The bucket cache is bounded by
  `PATIENT_PORTAL_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_BUCKETS`. Keep shared edge/load-balancer throttles in front of
  every production deployment because worker-local counters are not distributed. The packaged
  [`deploy/nginx.conf`](carlos_patient_portal/deploy/nginx.conf) provides route-specific limits,
  PHI-safe access logging, and CARLOS-header isolation. Tune it from a representative host run of
  `carlos-patient-portal-maintenance benchmark-password-hashing`; do not copy example rates into
  production without validating worker count, CPU, and memory limits.
- `PATIENT_PORTAL_MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` returns `503` and `Retry-After` on patient-facing routes
  while keeping `/health`, `/internal/health/db`, and `/internal/readiness` available. Tune the
  retry hint with `PATIENT_PORTAL_MAINTENANCE_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS`.
- `PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` defaults to a conservative 9,150 days, which guarantees at
  least 25 complete calendar years including leap years. Retention obligations run both ways —
  PHIPA/PIPEDA set a minimum, while privacy law and clinic policy can require deletion — so a
  shorter value is configurable, but only with `PATIENT_PORTAL_ALLOW_SHORT_AUDIT_RETENTION=true`
  and never below 30 days. A shortened retention is logged at startup as a warning and written to
  the audit trail as a `retention.policy_override` event, so narrowing the security log is itself
  visible in the security log. Audit pruning stays explicit so clinics can align the job with
  legal-retention processes.
- Requests emit PHI-safe structured log records containing a generated/canonical request ID,
  route template, method, status, and duration. `/internal/metrics` exposes aggregate status-class
  and delivery-failure counters without patient identifiers.
- Non-development application startup disables Uvicorn's raw access logger. Production proxies must
  also avoid raw request targets and patient-bearing paths: log only a normalized route/location,
  method, status, request ID, and timing. Never log query strings. Keep Uvicorn `--no-access-log`
  in the production launch command as defense in depth.

Minimum pilot alerts:

- Page the service owner when readiness is unavailable for 5 minutes or the schema is not current.
- Page on any sustained unlock-secret decryption failure or backup/restore failure.
- Alert on a 5xx rate above 1% for 5 minutes, repeated database 503s, or MFA/reset delivery failures.
- Alert security staff on an unusual increase in account lockouts or rate-limit responses.
- Ship application logs and audit-event exports to access-controlled, append-only centralized
  storage, with request IDs preserved for correlation.

The clinic/deployment operator owns SMTP/SMS delivery, database and backup alerts, restore drills,
and incident response. CARLOS maintainers own application regression alerts and migration
compatibility. Runbooks must identify both contacts before pilot traffic is enabled.

## Migrations

```bash
alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

Installed wheel deployments can run packaged migrations without a source checkout:

```bash
carlos-patient-portal-migrate
```

This PR adds the portal foundation, initial staff invite table, initial patient account table, and
initial audit event table. It also adds portal-owned session, MFA challenge, password reset token,
and encrypted unlock-secret tables.

Migration `0005_pending_email_confirmation` refuses to downgrade while pending email-change
requests or email-change audit events exist, so a rollback cannot silently discard evidence that a
patient asked to move the address their verification codes are delivered to.
Migration `0007_durable_outbound_delivery` refuses to downgrade while a delivery is queued or
leased, and `0008_phone_contact_confirmation` refuses to discard a pending phone-ownership proof.
Migration `0003_portal_lifecycle_hardening` refuses to downgrade while v3-only encrypted records,
pending secrets, disabled accounts, superseded reviews, or v3 audit events exist. This prevents a
rollback from dropping encryption context or lifecycle evidence. Preserve or transform those rows
under an approved retention and key-management procedure before retrying a downgrade.
Migration `0002_staff_identity_audit` preflights FHIR audit events before changing schema, and
`0004_invite_issuance_history` similarly refuses to discard superseded invite history.

Keep every revision id to 32 characters or fewer. Alembic creates `alembic_version.version_num` as
`VARCHAR(32)`; SQLite ignores the declared width but PostgreSQL enforces it, so a longer id passes
the test suite and the SQLite round trip while leaving every PostgreSQL database unable to reach
head. `tests/test_review_blocker_regressions.py` fails the build on an over-long id.

## Pilot Operations

Run audit retention pruning from an installed wheel:

```bash
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance prune-audit --dry-run
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance prune-audit --batch-size 1000
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance cleanup-transient-auth --dry-run
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance cleanup-transient-auth --retention-days 30
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance export-audit --after-id 0 --batch-size 1000
```

Apply [`deploy/postgresql-audit-roles.sql`](carlos_patient_portal/deploy/postgresql-audit-roles.sql)
after migrations. The web/outbox runtime role can select and append audit events but cannot update,
delete, or truncate them. Configure `PATIENT_PORTAL_MAINTENANCE_DATABASE_URL` with the separate
audit-maintenance role only in the offline prune job; destructive pruning refuses the runtime URL.
For PostgreSQL, the pruning command compares the live runtime and maintenance database identities
after connection parameters are resolved, and production pruning requires TLS on both sessions.
Checkpoint each successful JSONL export by its final `id` and ship it to an access-controlled,
append-only centralized sink before advancing the checkpoint.

The built-in backup/restore helper is intentionally limited to file-backed SQLite databases for
local development and small pilot recovery drills:

```bash
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance backup-sqlite --output /secure/backups/portal.db
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance restore-sqlite --input /secure/backups/portal.db --overwrite
```

SQLite backup and restore are development-only. Stop every portal process and SQLite client before
restore. The restore command rejects an existing
destination `-wal` or `-shm` sidecar rather than risking a false-success restore over live WAL state;
checkpoint and close the database cleanly, verify the sidecars are gone, run restore, then restart
the application and readiness checks.

PostgreSQL deployments should use managed database snapshots, PITR, or `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` from
the deployment platform. Before a pilot, run and document at least one restore drill against a
non-production database.

Before pilot traffic, record evidence that the PostgreSQL data volume, every snapshot, every
backup/export, and backup transport are encrypted. Keep storage-encryption keys outside the
database account and restrict snapshot/restore permissions separately from the portal runtime
role. The application encrypts reset payloads and unlock secrets itself, but patient email, phone,
demographic number, and audit metadata intentionally remain queryable database columns and depend
on this infrastructure control.

Keep `PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET`, `PATIENT_PORTAL_IDENTITY_PROOF_SECRET`,
`PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_HASH_SECRET`, outbox encryption keys, and unlock-secret encryption keys as
separate random values in the deployment secret manager. For unlock-secret rotation, configure
`PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` as a JSON object containing the old and new keys,
set `PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ACTIVE_KEY_ID` to the new key, and run:

```bash
carlos-patient-portal-maintenance rotate-unlock-secrets --batch-size 100
```

Repeat until the command reports zero, verify reads and a backup, then retire the old key. New writes
always use the active key; reads select the retained key by each record's `encryption_key_id`.
The rotation command also upgrades legacy unlock-secret ciphertext to the record-bound v2
encryption context.

The remaining secrets have deliberately different rotation behavior:

- Rotating `PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET` invalidates all sessions, MFA challenges, reset tokens,
  and CSRF tokens. Schedule it as a patient sign-out event. The portal does not use this value as a
  key directly: `token_keys.py` derives five independent HKDF keys from it, one each for CSRF
  signatures, session tokens, MFA challenge/code hashes, password-reset tokens, and email-change
  tokens, so a value minted for one purpose cannot be valid in another. All five rotate together
  with the secret. The email-change key also protects phone-ownership proof codes, so rotating
  this secret additionally invalidates any contact change waiting on its confirmation — plan for
  patients having to restart those.
- Rotating `PATIENT_PORTAL_IDENTITY_PROOF_SECRET` invalidates pending invitations; reissue them
  after cutover.
- Rotating `PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_HASH_SECRET` changes pseudonymous client/invite correlations;
  record the cutover time for investigations.
- Rotating `PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` does not require a synchronised restart. Set
  `PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` to the new value and
  `PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN_PREVIOUS` to the outgoing one, restart the portal, cut CARLOS
  over to the new token, then clear `_PREVIOUS` and restart the portal again. Both values are
  accepted while `_PREVIOUS` is set, so leaving it configured permanently defeats the rotation;
  treat clearing it as part of the same change.

## CARLOS Internal API

Set `PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` to enable the production staff/service contract. Requests
must include its Bearer token and an `X-CARLOS-Staff-Assertion`. Configure
`PATIENT_PORTAL_INTERNAL_STAFF_ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEY` with CARLOS's raw Ed25519 public key encoded as
unpadded base64url. CARLOS signs a compact `<payload>.<signature>` assertion for the authenticated
provider. The JSON payload must contain exactly `iss`, `aud`, `iat`, `exp`, `jti`, `provider_id`,
`provider_name`, `clinic_id`, and `permissions`; use issuer `carlos`, audience
`carlos-patient-portal-internal-api`, a canonical UUID `jti`, and a lifetime no longer than 120
seconds. The portal verifies the signature, expiry, clinic, and permission before handling a staff
request. CARLOS must keep the Ed25519 private key outside the portal deployment.

The service token still authenticates CARLOS as a workload, while the signed assertion binds the
specific provider and permissions. Keep `/internal/carlos/` reachable only from CARLOS application
instances, terminate TLS on that path, and strip patient-supplied `X-CARLOS-*` headers at the edge.
The reference nginx policy forwards only the signed assertion to the internal route.

Permissions are deliberately narrow:

- `portal.invite.manage`: create, list, resend, and revoke clinic-scoped invites.
- `portal.account.unlock`: unlock a patient and require a fresh password reset.
- `portal.account.manage`: read portal status and disable/re-enable patient access.
- `portal.secret.manage`: idempotently create, publish, and revoke generated email passphrases.
- `portal.contact.review`: list and approve/reject pending patient contact changes.

A contact-review decision controls only whether CARLOS should copy the verified portal contact into
the chart. Rejection deliberately does not roll back the patient's proven portal contact. If the
review indicates suspected takeover, staff must separately disable portal access with
`portal.account.manage`, which immediately revokes sessions, pending MFA, and reset artifacts.

The service token authenticates CARLOS itself; provider ID and permissions must be derived from the
authenticated CARLOS session by the CARLOS server, never accepted from a browser. Every mutation
retains the stable provider ID, display snapshot, clinic scope, and target resource in the audit
trail. A duplicate unlock-secret `source_reference` returns the original record and plaintext
through the same audited disclosure path, so a CARLOS retry after a timeout is safe; a revoked
source reference returns a conflict.
The generated OpenAPI contract includes explicit request, response, pagination, one-time plaintext,
and error models for these routes.

Invite retention is state-specific: accepted invite records are retained with the long-term audit
record; expired pending, revoked, and superseded records are eligible for transient cleanup only
after the configured cleanup delay. Cleanup rechecks status and expiry in the delete statement so a
concurrent state transition cannot delete a renewed record.

## Development Invite API

The staff invite skeleton is available only when `PATIENT_PORTAL_ENVIRONMENT=development` and
`PATIENT_PORTAL_ENABLE_DEV_ADMIN=true`. It also requires a development-only Bearer token. It is
intentionally hidden outside development until real CARLOS staff authentication is wired in.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/dev/admin/invites \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CARLOS-Staff-Actor: CarlosDoc" \
  -d '{
    "demographic_no": 1234,
    "email": "example.patient@example.com",
    "date_of_birth": "1980-05-20",
    "health_card_number": "ABCD 1234-5678"
  }'

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CARLOS-Staff-Actor: CarlosDoc" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/dev/admin/invites?demographic_no=1234

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/dev/admin/invites/1/resend \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CARLOS-Staff-Actor: CarlosDoc"

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/dev/admin/invites/1/revoke \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CARLOS-Staff-Actor: CarlosDoc"

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/dev/admin/accounts/1/unlock \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PATIENT_PORTAL_DEV_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-CARLOS-Staff-Actor: CarlosDoc"
```

Invite tokens are shown only on create/resend responses. The database stores only the token hash.
The API reports `issued_count`, `last_issued_at`, and `last_issued_by`; these describe token
issuance, not successful email/SMS delivery. Resend invalidates the previous token immediately, so
CARLOS must deliver the returned replacement and record delivery outcome in its own durable
messaging workflow.
When identity proof is supplied, the database stores only per-invite salted keyed hashes of email,
date of birth, and HCN/HIN values. Invites carry a seven-day `expires_at` timestamp so the activation
endpoint has a clear server-side expiry boundary. Invite list responses default to 10 records and are
capped at 100 records per request.

The current development API requires email, date of birth, and HCN/HIN at invite creation time so it
cannot create invites that patients are unable to activate. The CARLOS-backed staff action should
populate those proof hashes from CARLOS demographics instead of staff-entered JSON fields.
The development API derives the staff actor from `X-CARLOS-Staff-Actor`; the production CARLOS
integration should derive it from authenticated CARLOS provider context instead of client JSON.
Creating a new pending invite for the same patient revokes older pending invites. Identity proof
validation happens before older invites are revoked, so invalid replacement attempts leave the
current pending invite usable. Creating an invite after the patient already has a portal account
returns a conflict. Staff create, list, resend, and revoke actions write audit events.
The development unlock endpoint clears lockout counters, revokes active sessions/MFA challenges, and
sets `force_password_reset=true`; the patient must then complete the reset flow before sign-in.

## Patient Activation API

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/activate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invite_code": "<invite_token>",
    "email": "example.patient@example.com",
    "date_of_birth": "1980-05-20",
    "health_card_number": "ABCD-1234 5678",
    "username": "patient.username",
    "password": "Stronger1!word",
    "mfa_delivery_method": "sms",
    "phone_number": "+16135550199"
  }'
```

Activation checks the invite code, email, date of birth, and HCN/HIN together and returns a generic
failure when they do not match. Usernames are normalized to lowercase and must be unique. Passwords
are hashed with Argon2id before storage. Non-development activation requires SMS MFA with a valid
phone number and configured SMS gateway; completing the first sign-in proves receipt at that number.
Email remains the password-recovery channel and
is therefore not accepted as an independent sign-in factor outside local development. Existing
pre-pilot accounts whose preference is email must have a phone added by staff before they can next
sign in.

Activation accepts the CSRF-protected browser form or `application/json`; request bodies are capped
at 16 KiB before validation. Failed activation attempts are audited and rate-limited without storing
raw HCN/HIN, date-of-birth, invite-code, or raw client address values. Client address hashes use
`PATIENT_PORTAL_AUDIT_HASH_SECRET`.

## Patient Auth API

Login accepts either the server-rendered form with CSRF or JSON. Browser form submissions render the
MFA form when MFA is required, or redirect to `/portal` when sign-in is complete. JSON clients receive
the same opaque challenge/session tokens in the response body and should use the bearer token API.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "patient.username", "password": "Stronger1!word"}'
```

When MFA is required, login returns an opaque `mfa_challenge_token`. Verify the SMS code
to create a session:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/mfa/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mfa_challenge_token": "<challenge>", "code": "123456"}'

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <session_token>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/session

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <session_token>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/logout
```

Production MFA resend supports SMS. Development also supports captured email MFA for local demos:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/mfa/resend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mfa_challenge_token": "<challenge>", "mfa_delivery_method": "sms"}'
```

Password reset uses a generic request response and a one-time token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/password-reset/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "patient.username", "email": "example.patient@example.com"}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/auth/password-reset/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reset_token": "<reset_token>", "new_password": "Changed1!word"}'
```

Development responses include `development_mfa_code` and `development_reset_token` only when needed
for local testing. Production responses do not expose raw MFA codes or reset tokens. Configured SMTP
delivers MFA codes and one-time password-reset links without storing their raw values. The database
stores keyed hashes of MFA codes, reset tokens, and session tokens. Sign-in, MFA, reset, lockout,
unlock, and logout write audit events.

Successful browser login/MFA form submissions set an HttpOnly portal session cookie scoped to
`/portal` so the server-rendered dashboard can be used without putting bearer tokens in page scripts.
JSON API responses do not set that cookie; API clients should use the returned bearer
`session_token`.

## Patient Dashboard

```bash
curl -H "Cookie: carlos_portal_session=<session_token>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/portal
```

Dashboard routes:

- `/portal` shows the module dashboard.
- `/portal/account` shows account, contact, password, and MFA settings.
- `/portal/email-passwords` shows searchable, provider/date-filtered, paginated generated email
  password records for the authenticated patient. Passphrases are decrypted, audited, and returned
  one at a time only after the patient supplies their current password and selects Reveal. Bearer
  clients use `POST /api/patient/email-passwords/{id}/reveal` with `current_password` in the JSON
  body; the old session-only `GET` disclosure route is intentionally not exposed.
- `/portal/help` shows clinic help details.
- `POST /portal/logout` clears the portal session cookie and writes a logout audit event.

The dashboard is server-rendered and responsive. Desktop uses a left module rail; mobile uses a
horizontal module bar with logout kept in the top-right header area.
Changing the email address is a two-step flow. Submitting the contact form changes nothing on the
account: it records a pending request, emails a one-time confirmation link to the proposed address,
and notifies the current address that a change was asked for. Verification codes and password-reset
links keep going to the current address until the link is used, so a mistyped address strands
nothing and a stolen password alone cannot move the recovery channel. Opening the link applies the
new email and phone together, revokes reset/MFA factors tied to the old destination, notifies both
addresses, and creates the immutable CARLOS demographic-sync review.

The confirmation link expires after `PATIENT_PORTAL_EMAIL_CHANGE_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` (24 hours by
default) and is one-time. Requesting another change revokes the previous link, so a corrected typo
cannot leave the mistyped address able to take the account. A request whose confirmation email
cannot be delivered is revoked rather than left pending. A new or changed phone number must prove ownership
before it becomes an MFA destination: `account_settings` sets `phone_confirmation_required`,
stores `phone_confirmed_at = None`, sends a six-digit code, verifies it with `compare_digest`,
and fails closed unless both the email and phone confirmations are present. Migration 0008 and
four columns back this.

Removing a phone number is the one contact change that still applies immediately without
confirmation, which is deliberate: it withdraws an MFA destination rather than adding one.

CARLOS must update eChart first and then confirm the exact review `revision`; repeat
confirmations are idempotent and stale revisions return a conflict. Contact-change notices are sent
only after the database commit, and their delivery is backed by the durable outbox:
`enqueue_contact_change_delivery` queues an `OUTBOX_KIND_CONTACT_CHANGE` row from both routes,
which the worker retries with leases and terminal failure auditing.

## Unlock Secret Storage

`carlos_patient_portal.unlock_secrets` owns generated passphrase storage for encrypted CARLOS
emails.
It provides service functions to generate, create, list, read/decrypt, and revoke secrets. Stored
passphrases use AES-256-GCM with a key derived from
`PATIENT_PORTAL_UNLOCK_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`; audit events record create/read/revoke without
storing the raw passphrase.

For production integration, `/internal/carlos/patients/{demographic_no}/unlock-secrets` generates a
clinic-scoped, permission-checked, idempotent password in `pending` state using `source_reference`.
After CARLOS successfully encrypts and sends the message it calls
`/internal/carlos/unlock-secrets/{id}/publish`; send failure calls
`/internal/carlos/unlock-secrets/{id}/revoke`. Patient and FHIR surfaces expose only published
records. The caller supplies a service Bearer token plus
authenticated CARLOS provider ID, display name, clinic ID, and permission headers. Stable provider
IDs and target secret IDs are retained in the audit trail.

The normal internal API never accepts caller-supplied plaintext. Generated values use the PR #3135
format `word-word-###-word-word-###`, selecting four words
uniformly from the reviewed 4096-word list and six independent decimal digits. This provides about
68 bits of entropy while remaining copyable and readable to patients.

The service functions require clinic scope and either account or demographic scope for reads and
revokes. Patient-facing routes should pass the authenticated account id; staff/CARLOS-side routes
can use the clinic id plus `demographic_no`.

## Interoperability Contract

The MVP interoperability scope is intentionally narrow: this package validates the patient identity
data shape this portal slice owns against concrete FHIR and HL7 targets without claiming a complete
general-purpose exchange server:

- FHIR target: R4 `CapabilityStatement`, `Patient`, `DocumentReference`, `Organization`,
  `Practitioner`, `OperationOutcome`, and search `Bundle` resources under `/fhir`. Resources are
  built with `fhir.resources==5.1.1`, and generated examples are checked in CI with the official
  HL7 FHIR validator CLI. Searches support the parameters declared in `/fhir/metadata`, including
  `_id`, `_count`, `_offset`, and `DocumentReference.subject`. Bundle totals cover all matches and
  canonical previous/next links use `PATIENT_PORTAL_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. Authentication uses a
  patient-scoped portal Bearer session and is explicitly not SMART on FHIR.
- HL7 v2 target: v2.5.1 ADT A04 patient-registration trigger using HL7apy validation plus the
  packaged CARLOS profile artifact
  `carlos_patient_portal/interop_profiles/carlos_patient_registration_adt_a04_v251.json`. The
  message emits CARLOS demographic number and HCN/HIN as repeated `PID-3` identifiers and emits
  email using `PID-13` XTN email components.

Future CARLOS integration work should reuse this module or replace it with a stricter CARLOS profile
before exposing additional clinical exchange endpoints.

## Tests

```bash
pytest --cov=carlos_patient_portal --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml
ruff check .
```

The test command enforces the configured 85% minimum Python coverage and writes the report consumed
by SonarCloud.
