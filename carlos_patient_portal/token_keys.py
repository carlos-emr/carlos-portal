"""Per-purpose key derivation for the portal's authentication tokens.

`PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET` is a single configured value that several unrelated constructions
depend on: CSRF signatures, session-token hashes, MFA challenge-token and code hashes,
password-reset token hashes, and email-change confirmation tokens. Handing the same key to all of
them made their separation depend on every call site remembering to pass a distinct purpose string
to `hash_auth_token` — a convention, enforced by nothing. Deriving an independent key per purpose
here makes it structural instead: a signature produced for one role cannot verify in another even
if a purpose string is omitted.

The purpose strings inside `hash_auth_token` are deliberately kept as well. They now separate the
sub-purposes that share one derived key (session tokens and their lookups), and they cost nothing.

Rotating the configured secret rotates every derived key together, which signs every patient
out and invalidates pending MFA challenges and reset tokens. That is already the documented
behaviour of rotating `PATIENT_PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET`; deriving keys does not change it.
