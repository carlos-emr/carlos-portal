"""Locale resolution and the portal's user-facing text.

Translations are not written yet. Rather than advertise four languages that do nothing, the
machinery is real and every locale resolves through `TEXT_CATALOG` with a per-key fallback to
English: selecting French switches the locale, persists it, and renders the English string for any
key French has not defined. Adding a translation is then only a matter of adding keys to
`TEXT_CATALOG["fr"]` — no route, template, or context change is needed, and a partial translation
renders rather than raising KeyError.
