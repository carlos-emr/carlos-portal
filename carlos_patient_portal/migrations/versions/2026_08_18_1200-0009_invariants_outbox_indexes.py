"""Make three state invariants structural and index the outbox foreign keys.

Each constraint here already held in application code; the point is that nothing stopped a future
edit, a new code path, or a manual UPDATE from breaking it:

- A session carrying revoked_reason without revoked_at is a live bearer session that the audit trail
  reports as revoked, because authentication gates on the timestamp alone.
- An outbound delivery in 'processing' with no lease is invisible to the reclaim query
  (`lease_expires_at <= now` is NULL, never true), so it is never retried, never reaches 'failed',
  and strands a password-reset message with no failure code and no alert.
- A confirmed contact change without both ownership proofs would move the MFA destination and sync
  to the CARLOS demographic record on unproven input.

The indexes cover patient_portal_outbound_deliveries.reset_token_id, which is ON DELETE CASCADE
while reset tokens are bulk-deleted by cleanup-transient-auth. Unindexed, PostgreSQL enforces the
cascade with a sequential scan per deleted parent row, so the DELETE exceeds statement_timeout and
transient-auth cleanup stops completing at all.
